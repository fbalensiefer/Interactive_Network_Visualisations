    "# Introduction to News Sentiment Analysis with Eikon Data APIs - a Python example\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will demonstrate how we can conduct a simple sentiment analysis of news delivered via our new [Eikon Data APIs](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/eikon-data-apis). Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a big area of interest for those looking to gain insight and new sources of value from the vast quantities of unstructured data out there. The area is quite complex and there are many resources online that can help you familiarise yourself with this very interesting area. There are also many different packages that can help you as well as many different approaches to this problem. Whilst these are beyond the scope of this article - I will go through a simple implementation which will give you a swift enough introduction and practical codebase for further exploration and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Thomson Reuters Eikon** with access to new [Eikon Data APIs](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/eikon-data-apis)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 2.x/3.x**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Python Packages:** eikon, pandas, numpy, beautifulsoup, textblob, datetime \n",
    "\n",
    "**Required corpora download:** >>>python -m textblob.download_corpora (this is required by the sentiment engine to generate sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a field which enables computers to understand human language (voice or text). This is quite a big area of research and a little enquiry on your part will furnish you with the complexities of this problem set. Here we will be focussing on one application of this called *Sentiment Analysis*. In our case we will be taking news articles(unstructured text) for a particular company, **IBM**, and we will attempt to grade this news to see how postive, negative or neutral it is. We will then try to see if this news has had an impact on the shareprice of **IBM**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this really well is a non-trivial task, and most universtities and financial companies will have departments and teams looking at this. We ourselves provide machine readable news products with News Analytics (such as sentiment) over our **Elektron** platform in realtime at very low latency - these products are essentially consumed by *algorithmic applications* as opposed to *humans*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to do a similar thing as simply as possible to illustrate the key elements - our task is significantly eased by not having to do this in a low latency environment. We will be abstracting most of the complexities to do with the mechanics of actually analysing the text to various packages. You can then easily replace the modules such as the sentiment engine etc to improve your results as your understanding increases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So lets get started. First lets load the packages that we will need to use and set our app_id. "

The first parameter for this call is a query. You dont really need to know this query language as you can generate it using the **News Monitor App** (type **NEWS** into Eikon search bar) in **Eikon**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see here I have just typed in 2 search terms, **IBM**, for the company, and, **English**, for the language I am interested in (in our example we will only be able to analyse English language text - though there are corpora, packages, methods you can employ to target other languages - though these are beyond the scope of this article). You can of course use any search terms you wish.\n",

Thankfully there is plenty of information to guide us in this.

    "From our initial results - it would appear that there might be some small directional differences in returns between the positive and neutral groups over shorter time frames (twoM and fiveM) after news broke. This is a pretty good basis for further investigation. So where could we go from here?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a relatively small *n* here so we might want to increase the size of the study. \n",
    "\n",
    "We might also want to try to seperate out more positive or negative news - ie change the threshold of the buckets to try to identify more prominent sentiment articles - maybe that could have more of an impact on performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of capturing news impact - we have thrown a lot of news articles out as they happened outside of market hours - as it is more complex to ascertain impact - we might try to find a way of including some of this in our analysis - I mentioned looking at overseas listings **GDR/ADRs** or surrogates above. Alternatively, we could using **EXACTLY** the same process looking at all news for an index future - say the **S&P500 emini** - as this trades on Globex pretty much round the clock - so we would be throwing out a lot less of the news articles? Great I hear you cry - but would each news article be able to influence a whole index? Are index futures more sensitive to some types of articles than others? Is there a temporal element to this? These are all excellent questions. Or what about cryptocrurrencies? They trade 24/7? and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also investigate what is going on with our sentiment engine. We might be able to generate more meaningful results by tinkering with the underlyng processes and parameters. Using a different, more domain-specific corpora might help us to generate more relevant scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will see there is plenty of scope to get much more involved here. \n",
    "\n",
    "This article was intended as an introduction to this most interesting of areas. I hope to have de-mystified this area for you somewhat and shown how it is possible to get started with this type of complex analysis using only a few lines of code, a simple easy to use yet powerfull API and some really fantastic packages, to generate some meaningful results."
